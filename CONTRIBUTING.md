# Contributing to Quark

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Quark!

The easiest way for you to help is just by writing programs and testing them with each new early version of the compiler. Feel free to open an issue for anything that may seem off or if you just simply want to request a feature.

If you are confused on where to start, try implementing basic data structures or make spinoffs of existing standard library [source files](lib/).
